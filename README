Tools for GNSS code generators, acquisition, and tracking, all in the python / numpy environment for easy prototyping

The Numba JIT compiler is used to speed up some computational kernels such as NCOs and code generators.  Building Numba
for a given platform requires some digging for the right versions of LLVM and other dependencies.  Another
option is to install binaries from Anaconda, which is straightforward:

http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html

bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
conda install numpy scipy numba
